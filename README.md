This is a command-line application written in C# that allows users to manage their recipes. 

The program allows users to enter the recipes details including ingredients and steps, displays the recipe,
scale the recipe, reset the quantities and clear all the data.
The application stores data only in the memory while the software is running. 

To run this application you should: 
    Download or clone the repository to your local machine. 
    Open the file solution ('Coding.sln') in Visual Studio.
    Build the solution and compile the application. 

Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various actions like entering the recipe details, displaying the recipe, 
scaling the recipe, resetting the quantities and clearing all the data. The user should enter the ingredients, steps to cook the recipe, enter the amount of calories in the recipe and which food group the ingredient belongs to. 
If the users calorie count is higher than 300 the application will display a message saying the recipe calories exceed 300.
